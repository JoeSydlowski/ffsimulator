# Best Ball Mania edge engine — working directory

Implementation of the proposal in [`../suite/BESTBALL_PROPOSAL.md`](../suite/BESTBALL_PROPOSAL.md).
Data landscape + backtest methodology live there; this README tracks build status.

## Layout
- `R/00_ingest.R` — **phase 0**: raw Underdog dumps → one canonical Parquet schema.
- `R/01_field_study.R` — **phase 1 (the gate)**: engine-free reconstruction of entries
  and descriptive advancement analysis.
- `data/` — raw dumps + derived Parquet. **Gitignored** (GBs, re-downloadable).

## How to run (from `dev/bestball/`)
```sh
# 1. fetch a year's dump into data/raw/ (example: 2021 regular season, 452 MB)
curl -o data/raw/bbm2021_regular.csv \
  https://assets.underdogfantasy.com/underblog/BBM_II_Data_Dump_Regular_Season_01312022.csv
# 2. ingest -> data/parquet/2021_BBMII.parquet
Rscript R/00_ingest.R
# 3. field study
Rscript R/01_field_study.R
```

## Status
- [x] **Phase 0 ingest** — canonical schema + Parquet writer; per-year `specs` map handles
  schema drift. Validated on 2021 (2.8M picks → 40 MB Parquet, 11× compression).
- [~] **Phase 1 field study** — machinery working on 2021; descriptive/uncontrolled pass done.
  **Confound controls (player FE, fix-the-anchor stacks, concentration diagnostic) not yet built** — that's the real gate.
- [ ] Add remaining years (2020 xlsx, 2022 split-parts, 2023–25 rich 5 GB → streaming ingest).
- [ ] Stack detection (needs player→NFL-team join; clean only on rich years via `player_id`).

## First findings (2021, descriptive — NOT yet a proven edge)
- **Rule validated:** 155,375 entries in 12,948 pods, exactly 12/pod × 18 picks; advancement
  = top-2-of-pod by `roster_points` at **99.98%** agreement with `made_playoffs`. Our model
  of the game matches reality.
- **Cutline:** regular-season advance line (2nd-place points) median **1688.8** (P5–P95
  1621–1773).
- **Construction correlates with advancement (raw):**
  - Positional structure advance rates span **0.137 → 0.197** (baseline 0.167); 3-TE and
    2-QB builds skew high, 3-QB/light-RB low.
  - Draft-value captured (`overall_pick − adp`) is **monotonic**: reachiest quintile 0.134 →
    most-value quintile 0.190; same shape for late-round value.
- **Caveat (why this isn't the gate yet):** these are *uncontrolled*. Both signals are
  confounded — structure with *which players* (the Kelce problem), and draft-value with
  *drafter skill* (an engaged user, not an adoptable rule). Isolating the **structural**
  component (player fixed effects, fix-the-anchor stack tests, concentration diagnostic) is
  the next step and the actual go/no-go.
